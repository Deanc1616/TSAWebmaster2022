About Us </h2>
        </center>

 <br></br>
<p style="text-decoration:none; color:#ff6e40; family:calistoga, georgia;"> 
Founded in 2021, the goal of Fun Run Friends and Family Virtual Races was to connect people during troubling times using running. Running has been around since the beginning of time, but running and the internet have not been paired together until much after. It is our organization's goal to ultimately combine the rush of racing with safety of doing so virtually. There is still competition, as there is an online leaderboard with rankings, as well as forums to speak with others, and results will remain online officially.  
<br></br>
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many races have been forced to be canceled across the nation, but also locally in this area. Because of this, we aim to bring back some of these races in a safe manner. This is done to bring together the community, to have fun, and to exercise/get outside. These races were usually holiday-related, large community events, and can still be done online.

<center>How do I sign up?</center>
</h4>

<br></br>
   
<p style="text-decoration:none; color:#ff6e40; family:calistoga, georgia;"> It's quite simple! We have a form to sign up for one of the races, which you can do whenever! Sign up <a style = "color: #ffc13b;" href= "signup.html">here!</a> </p>
  
<br></br>
   
<h4 style = "color: #ffc13b; font-family:calistoga, georgia;"><center>When are these races exactly? How do I get on the leaderboards?</center></h4>

<br></br>
   
  <p style="text-decoration:none; color:#ff6e40; family:calistoga, georgia;">
  While the leaderboards will be up for every year within a month around a month before the race's official date and close the day after the race, you can technically submit a time whenever! These are also segments that can be compared on our Strava group, so make sure to sign up for that and get the most use out the online experience!</p>

<br></br>
   
<h4 style = "color: #ffc13b; font-family:calistoga, georgia;"><center>Why was Fun Run Friends and Family Virtual Races created? Can't you just run these on your own?</center></h4>

<br></br>

 <p style="text-decoration:none; color:#ff6e40; family:calistoga, georgia;"> While yes, you could just run this all on your own, here at Fun Run Friends and Family Virtual Races, we have found having others to make you accountable is the best way to make sure you stick to your goals. Self-discipline is tough, and having a way to connect to others in a tough time to work out together is beneficial and, as the title says, fun!</p>

<br></br>
   
<h4 style = "color: #ffc13b; font-family:calistoga, georgia;"><center>When will more races be aded to the website?</center></h4>
   
<br></br>

 <p style="text-decoration:none; color:#ff6e40; family:calistoga, georgia;"> There are so many different 5ks in the Burlington County and South Jersey area, showing the passion for running in our community. The best way to support these races is simply just looking on the internet for other races, and we will try our best to keep you informed on more and more courses in the future. Starting small will help us compile all of your results, and will eventually be updated, so stay tuned! <a style = "color: #ffc13b; font-family:calistoga, georgia;"href = "https://runningintheusa.com/classic/list/burlington-county-nj/upcoming/5k" target = "_blank">Check here</a> for other races going on in the area! </p>

<br></br>
   
<h4 style = "color: #ffc13b; font-family:calistoga, georgia;"><center>How do I collect data on my race/submit my times?</center></h4>

<br></br>

 <p style="text-decoration:none; color:#ff6e40; family:calistoga, georgia;">
   Again, this is a fairly easy process. For all of our official races, we have bibs with special chips in them, which will begin whenever you cross the start line, and finish when you cross the finish line. As these cost money to upkeep, we cannot have more than one up at a time, hence why official yearly leaderboards will only be collecting race data during a month or so surrounding the race. If not in this period, you can use a GPS or other type of running or fitness watch that tracks mileage and/or time, and can submit them to the public leaderboards, which does not require vefification. </p>

<br></br>
  
<h4 style = "color: #ffc13b; font-family:calistoga, georgia;"><center>How do I start? What do I need to start?</center></h4>

<br></br>

 <p style="text-decoration:none; color:#ff6e40; family:calistoga, georgia;"> Realistically, you do not need much at all to start running. All we personally reccomend is a good pair of shoes, preferably running shoes, and somewhere to run. Obviously being properly hydrated and fueled, so healthy foods and water is good to have, and something to time you or track mileage, like a GPS watch or fitness tracker is good. Dress for the weather, as if it is cold, wear layers, and if it is hot, take them off, but also a good idea would to be to have someone or a group to run with. That's why Fun Run Friends and Family Virtual Races is here, to help connect others!</p>

<br></br>
  
<h4 style = "color: #ffc13b; font-family:calistoga, georgia;"><center>Any other tips to get ready for a race?</center></h4>

<br></br>

 <p style="text-decoration:none; color:#ff6e40; family:calistoga, georgia;">Running some miles before will greatly enhance your chances of running well during one of these races. There are many different plans and workouts online to help, but just having fun with fitness is the best way to enjoy while still being healthy. As stated before, eating and drinking properly is another integral aspect, but so is working with a partner, group, team, or someone to keep you motivated. Make sure during the actual race to focus on breathing and form, don't go out too fast, and remember to never give up! You'll be ready to race in no time!
